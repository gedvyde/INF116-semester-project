## Hospital Stay Length Prediction - Data Science Project
This project focuses on predicting the expected length of hospital stays for patients using various machine learning models. The models utilize patient data, including demographic, physiological, and disease severity information, to make accurate predictions about hospital stay durations.

External Packages Used:
- numpy
- pandas
- plotly
- seaborn
- scipy
- sklearn
- pickle
- flask
- waitress
